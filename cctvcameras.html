									<h2>STATION CAMERA</h2>
									<p>These cameras are generally placed, and found on the outdoor tracks at a train station. This is
									so the outside can be monitered from the indoor ticket station, where it may be out of sight-range or line
								 of sight.</p>
								 	<p>Notice how the one in the image is looking in both directions. This helps the monitor cover a larger range</p>

									<h2>LOCAL DOME CAMERA</h2>
									<p>These dome cameras are typically more common, and are likely to be found either on the ceiling inside a building
									or on the outer wall. Generally both. This is so the employees or security can monitor both the outside and inside.</p>
									<p>The cameras are notably placed in areas where the occurence of shady practices may be common such as alleyways or
										isolated car-parks.</p>

									<h2>BUS CAMERA</h2>
									<p>Some people probably don't pay too much attention to what's on the ceiling of the bus, but you'll notice these small CAMERAS
									just hanging out on the ceiling. There is notably 3 of them. One near the driver, one in the middle of the bus (Refer to image) and
									one hidden in the back corner of the bus</p>
									<p>These monitor what goes on in the bus and cover the entire interior of the bus. Due to the small narrow space of the bus, there is really
										nothing to hide.</p>
