			<h1>CCTV CAMERAS</h1>
			<p>Scattered all around Wellington care these somewhat hidden cameras. They are there to provide us safety and
			security.</p>
			<p>These cameras vary in size and shape. Some are more obvious than others. These are typically placed in high-traffic areas, such 
			as malls or city streets, but you can find them in less populated areas as well.

			<h1>POWER LINES</h1>
			<p>Power lines tend to give us the most power, and such are a part of our daily lives 24/7. They are usually put in places
			where a normal, regular civillian cannot interact with, but you can see the lines tied along lamposts around your streets.</p>
