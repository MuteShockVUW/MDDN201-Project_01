						<h1>CCTV CAMERAS</h1>
						<p>Scattered all around Wellington care these somewhat hidden cameras. They are there to provide us safety and
						security.</p>
						<p>These cameras vary in size and shape. Some are more obvious than others. These are typically placed in high-traffic areas, such
						as malls or city streets, but you can find them in less populated areas as well.</p>

						<h1>POWER LINES</h1>
						<p>Power lines tend to give us the most power, and such are a part of our daily lives 24/7. They are usually put in places
						where a normal, regular civillian cannot interact with, but you can see the lines tied along lamposts around your streets.</p>
						<p>Were it not for these lines of surging energy, your facilities such as your kitchen appliances, desktop computer and TV would not work. Worst
						of all...Your internet modem is reliant on this.</p>

						<h1>TRAFFIC LIGHTS</h1>
						<p>These are large structural devices that are position strategically around roads in order to have indirect control over the flow of
						traffic.</p>
						<p>There are two kinds of Traffic Lights in Wellington. There are your standard Red, Yellow, and Green Light traffic lights that control
						the flow of the roads, but there are also ones for pedestrians. There are positioned at crossings that have high traffic and control the flow
						of traffic between the cars and the pedestrians</p>
